## Objective

I like this talk and how it was presented. But, it's not convenient to watch this long video again and/or read big Gist 
(which is actually a result of refactoring). Sometimes, it's better to have a step-by-step commits which represent the refactoring's evolution.
Having this You can re-create a refactoring by yourself.
